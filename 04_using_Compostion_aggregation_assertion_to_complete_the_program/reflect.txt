In this workshop I have finally understood the concept of aggregation and composition and when to use them.
I have used these functions in my workshop as the main contain the implementation of these function

Both have a relation with the classes
while as composition is implemented by direct containment
Object of the class is owned by object of owning class and object using this method cannot exist on its own
In simple terms object has another object.
For example:
If the delivery system is not working, the restaurant can still make orders, thus the restaurant has an aggregation of the
delivery and if a company have several departments and if the company closes all its departments
will no longer exist. Thus, company has a composition of departments.
In the other hand aggregation has an indirect containment using pointers, object is standalone.
Object is standalone, object can exist even if the object class is dead.

Also the copy function is used to initialize a class by making a copy of an object in the same class.
Move function is used to move ownership of the resources from one object to another.


In aggregation the copy function is used to copy one class to another existing class.
Move function is used to move ownership of the resources from one object to another.
