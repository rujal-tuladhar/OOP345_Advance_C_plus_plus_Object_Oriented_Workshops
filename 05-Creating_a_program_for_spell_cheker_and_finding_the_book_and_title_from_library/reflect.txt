This assignment was tricky compared to the previous one as there was trying to catch and template and lambda function involved.
The difficult part as usual was to check and find the errors. I have taken the help from the course lessons and YouTube videos for doing this workshop.

A lambda basically is a function just defined with a shorter syntax. Function is implemented when you provide several overloads to distinguish between the arguments.

Function always create complexity in a code to make a function of member variables.
To do that, we can use a different situation as per the value received.
We can do that by creating a duplicate value as a base class and making Movie and Book as its child class to avoid duplicate logic.

We cannot remove the default constructor as it is used while creating our constructor. When there is a custom constructor. While we runt the code there need to be a detailed constructor created, so we need different constructor to initialize all member variables.
